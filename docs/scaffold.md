# Scaffolding checklist

Run this once, immediately after cloning the starter. In Claude Code, run `/scaffold` and the agent
will conduct it as an interview. Otherwise work through it by hand.

The goal is a repo where `./scripts/check` passes on an empty project. Until that's true, nothing
else is real — the gate is what every later instruction depends on.

Keep the result small. This starter ships the minimum on purpose; what you add here should be a
lockfile, tool configs, and a source tree — not more documentation.

## 1. Identity

- [ ] Project name and one-sentence description decided
- [ ] `README.md` title and description replaced
- [ ] `.git` points at the right remote (`git remote -v`)
- [ ] `LICENSE` added, or a deliberate decision that this stays private and unlicensed

## 2. Stack

Decide these explicitly rather than letting the first file written imply them.

- [ ] Language and **pinned** version (`.nvmrc`, `.python-version`, `go.mod`, `.tool-versions`)
- [ ] Package manager, and its lockfile committed
- [ ] Framework, if any
- [ ] Directory layout: where source lives, where tests live, where config lives

### Layout and discovery — `docs/map.md`

The map is what makes "single source of truth" enforceable: an agent that can't find the existing
thing will confidently build a second one. Fill it in now, before any source file exists, so the
first file written already obeys it.

- [ ] Tier names chosen. The default `primitives / components / features / lib / config` is a
      recommendation — rename freely to fit the stack (`modules`, `services`, `internal`, `pkg`).
      Drop a tier you won't use rather than leaving it empty.
- [ ] Every `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` in `docs/map.md` replaced with a real path, and those directories
      created (a `.gitkeep` is fine until real files land)
- [ ] The `<!-- paths: ... -->` line at the bottom lists the same paths as the Tiers table
- [ ] Search recipes adjusted for the language — the `rg` patterns assume `export function`;
      change them to `def `, `func `, `pub fn` as appropriate. `{{RG_TYPE}}` takes an `rg` type
      *name*, not an extension: `ts`, `py`, `go` — `rg --type-list` has the full set
- [ ] Naming conventions section filled in with anything the formatter can't enforce
- [ ] Dependency direction enforced by a tool, not just documented — `no-restricted-paths`,
      `dependency-cruiser`, `import-linter`, `go-arch-lint` — and wired into `./scripts/check` as
      its own `run arch ...` step. No plugin for this stack? Write `scripts/arch` yourself; map.md
      says what it does and it is ~40 lines. Do not settle for the rule living only in prose.
- [ ] `./scripts/check` passes its `map` step

## 3. Quality tooling

Everything here exists so that AGENTS.md never has to describe style in prose.

- [ ] Formatter installed and configured (Prettier, Black, gofmt, rustfmt…)
- [ ] Linter installed and configured
- [ ] Type checking enabled in **strict** mode, if the language has it
- [ ] Test framework installed, with one trivial passing test to prove the wiring
- [ ] `.editorconfig` reviewed — indent size matches the formatter's config, and the stanzas for
      languages this project does not use are deleted
      (`.gitattributes` already pins LF endings; no change needed unless you add binary types)
- [ ] `.gitignore` pruned to this stack — it ships polyglot (`node_modules/`, `.venv/`, `target/`…).
      Delete the sections that do not apply and add what this stack generates. The `# Secrets`
      block stays as-is.

## 4. The gate

`scripts/check` runs every step even when one fails, so a single run reports every problem. Each
unconfigured step is a `run <name> todo "<suggested command>"` line — replace the whole
`todo "..."` with the real command, keeping the `run <name>` wrapper so failures still accumulate.

- [ ] `./scripts/setup` installs dependencies from a clean checkout (replace the stub `printf`/`exit`)
- [ ] `./scripts/test` runs the suite (same)
- [ ] `./scripts/dev` runs the app locally, wrapping `op run` (same). This is the only place the run
      command is written down — AGENTS.md, README and `.env.example` point at the script, never
      repeat it. A longhand `op run --env-file=... -- <server> <flags>` copied into three files is
      three copies to keep in sync, and they will diverge on the first flag added.
- [ ] `./scripts/check` — format, lint, typecheck, arch, test all replaced; delete the `typecheck`
      step entirely if the language is untyped, and the `arch` step if nothing enforces the tier
      boundaries in docs/map.md
- [ ] Verified: `./scripts/check` exits 0, and exits non-zero with **all** failures listed when you
      deliberately break something

## 5. Environment and secrets

The goal is no plaintext secret on disk at all — not just none committed. `.env.example` explains
the mechanism; read it before doing this section.

- [ ] `.env.example` lists every required key, as `op://vault/item/field` references
- [ ] A dedicated 1Password vault exists for this project, so access is scoped to it
- [ ] `./scripts/dev` wraps `op run --env-file=.env.example --` so nobody has to remember it (step 4)
- [ ] `op run --env-file=.env.example -- env | grep <A_KEY>` resolves (run it in your own shell,
      not through an agent — the output is plaintext and would land in the transcript)
- [ ] CI uses a service account: `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` as the only repo secret, *and* the
      workflow step is wrapped in `op run --env-file=.env.example --` — the token authenticates the
      `op` CLI but injects nothing by itself. Only if `./scripts/setup` or `./scripts/check` actually
      needs a secret; tests that supply their own fake values need neither, so leave both off until
      something fails for want of it (step 7)
- [ ] Config is read in exactly one module, which throws on a missing key; the rest of the code
      imports from it
- [ ] No `.env` on disk. If you skipped 1Password, `.env` is untracked and you accept the tradeoff.

## 6. AGENTS.md

`./scripts/check` enforces the first three of these — it fails while the file is over ~50 lines,
still contains `{{PLACEHOLDER}}`, or still contains the TEMPLATE block.

- [ ] Every `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` filled in
- [ ] TEMPLATE block at the top deleted
- [ ] Still under ~50 lines
- [ ] **Boundaries** section written with real entries — generated dirs, migrations, protected
      branches, anything that breaks if edited directly. This is the highest-value section.
- [ ] Example boundaries deleted

## 7. Automation

- [ ] `.github/workflows/check.yml` — add the setup action for this language after the checkout,
      reading the version from the pinned file rather than repeating it inline, and delete the
      placeholder `run: echo ::error::` step at the bottom. The commented alternatives in that file
      cover Node, Python, Go and Ruby. Delete the whole directory if this repo will not live on
      GitHub. Once step 9 removes this file, `./scripts/check` fails while the placeholder survives —
      until then only CI catches it.
- [ ] Pre-commit hook, if you want the gate locally too
- [ ] `.claude/settings.json` `allow` list extended with this project's own commands. Only add rules
      that actually prompt — `ls`, `cat`, `grep`, `find` and read-only `git` are built-in read-only
      and never prompt, so a rule for them is noise. Keep secret-readers out of `allow`: a blanket
      `Bash(rg:*)` or `Bash(sed:*)` weakens the `.env` denies, and so does a language interpreter —
      `Bash(ruby:*)`, `Bash(node:*)`, `Bash(python:*)` and their `bundle exec` / `npx` / `uv run`
      forms all read any file on disk via `-e` / `-c`. Allow the scripts, not the interpreter.
- [ ] `deny` left alone unless you know the syntax. Two traps: the names are enumerated rather than
      written `Read(.env.*)` because these are gitignore patterns with no negation, and the broad
      form would block `.env.example` — the one file agents must read. And `:*` is a *trailing*
      wildcard only; `Bash(cat:*.env*)` treats the colon as a literal and matches nothing. Bash file
      reads are already covered: a `Read` deny applies to `cat`, `head`, `tail` and `sed` in Bash
      (though not to a script that opens the file itself — that needs the sandbox).

## 8. First decision record

- [ ] Copy `docs/decisions/0000-template.md` to `0001-<slug>.md` and record the stack choice —
      why this language/framework, what was rejected. It's the cheapest one you'll ever write and it
      proves the habit exists.

## 9. Delete the scaffolding

Do the rewrites first — deleting the two files while something still links to them fails the
`links` step, and the `residue` step fails while any other mention survives.

- [ ] `README.md` rewritten to describe *this project*, not the template: no `/scaffold` link or
      instructions, no `docs/scaffold.md` row, no "stubs until scaffolded"
- [ ] `CLAUDE.md` — the `/scaffold` line deleted
- [ ] `scripts/check` — the `todo()` helper and its comment deleted (nothing calls it once step 4
      is done, including the `arch` step)
- [ ] `.github/workflows/check.yml` — the placeholder `run: echo ::error::` step deleted (step 7)
- [ ] `docs/map.md` — tiers you dropped removed from the table and the `<!-- paths: -->` line
- [ ] `docs/scaffold.md` (this file) deleted
- [ ] `.claude/commands/scaffold.md` deleted
- [ ] `./scripts/check` passes — the `residue` step now runs and finds nothing
- [ ] Commit: `chore: scaffold project`
